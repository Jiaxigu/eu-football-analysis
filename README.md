[This](https://www.kaggle.com/yonilev/the-most-predictable-league) kaggle kernel was __heavily__ referred to when I wrote this script.

The database is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/hugomathien/football-data-collection) as well as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer). Kudos to the owner of the database, [Hugo Mathien](https://github.com/hugomathien)!
